# Oculus Geometry

*Interactive and contemplative visual instrument*

---

## Description

**Oculus Geometry** is an interactive visual instrument focused on the exploration of geometry, time, and mathematical motion. It operates as a living perceptual piece: a space where forms, orbits, and numerical relationships unfold without imposed narrative, inviting observation, pause, and personal interpretation.

The system does not aim to represent physical phenomena nor to optimize immediate visual impact. Instead, it prioritizes structural coherence, temporal reproducibility, and contemplative experience.

---

## Repository Scope

This repository corresponds to a **demonstrative and open version** of the project. Its purpose is to:

* Document the visual behavior of the system
* Share an interactive geometric experience
* Serve as an experimental and contemplative base

The **conceptual and evolutionary core** of *Oculus Geometry* belongs to a broader line of research and **is intentionally not exposed** in this repository.

This repository represents a **conscious boundary**, not the complete instrument.

---

## Concept

*Oculus Geometry* explores:

* Geometric relationships driven by mathematical constants
* Time as a scalable and perceptual parameter
* Visual coherence through minimal interaction
* Long-term reproducibility over immediate effects

The project prioritizes structural clarity over the accumulation of features.

## Project Status

* **Public demo:** available
* **System core:** intentionally absent
* **Architecture:** designed for long-term growth

## Note

*Oculus Geometry* should not be interpreted as a library, a generic visualizer, or a scientific simulation. It is an **algorithmic contemplative instrument**, conceived to be observed rather than controlled, and tuned rather than optimized.
