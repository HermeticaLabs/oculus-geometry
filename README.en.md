# Oculus Geometry

**Oculus Geometry** is an interactive and contemplative visual instrument focused on geometry, time, and mathematical motion.

The project functions as a living perceptual piece: a space where forms, orbits, and numerical relationships unfold without imposed narrative, inviting observation, pause, and personal interpretation.

This repository corresponds to an open demonstrative version, intended to:

- Document the visual behavior of the system  
- Share an interactive geometric experience  
- Serve as an experimental and contemplative foundation  

The conceptual and evolutionary core of the system is part of a broader line of research and is not exposed in this repository.

---

## Concept

Oculus Geometry explores:

- Geometric relationships driven by mathematical constants  
- Time as a scalable and perceptual parameter  
- Visual coherence through minimal interaction  
- Long-term reproducibility over immediate effects  

The project prioritizes structural clarity over feature accumulation.

---

## Status

- Public demo: **available**  
- System core: **intentionally absent**  
- Architecture: **designed for long-term growth**  

This repository represents a **boundary**, not the complete instrument.
