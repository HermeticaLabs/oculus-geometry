# Oculus Geometry

**Oculus Geometry** is a contemplative, interactive visual instrument focused on geometry, time and mathematical motion.

It is conceived as a minimal system: no narrative, no gamification, no imposed external meaning — only structure, rhythm and form.

This repository contains a **public demo version** intended for viewing, execution and conceptual study.

---

## Concept

Oculus Geometry explores:

- Geometric relationships driven by mathematical constants  
- Time as a scalable and perceptual parameter  
- Visual coherence through minimal interaction  
- Long-term reproducibility over short-term effects  

The project prioritizes structural clarity over feature accumulation.

---

## Status

- Public demo: **available**
- Core system: **intentionally absent**
- Architecture: **designed for long-term growth**

This repository represents a **boundary**, not the complete instrument.
